# Data and Domain

This module covers the persistence layer and core domain types.

## Data layer

### `Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
Derives from `IdentityDbContext<ApplicationUser>` and exposes tables for `Projects`, `TodoItems`, `Celebrations`, `AuthEvents`, `DailyLoginStats`, `AuditLogs` and now `Events` for the calendar. Indexes on `TodoItem` enforce fast lookups by owner and due date, while `Event` rows are filtered by `IsDeleted` and indexed on `StartUtc` and `EndUtc` for range queries. Identity tables (users, roles, claims, etc.) are provided by the base class.

### `Data/DesignTimeDbContextFactory.cs`
Provides a design-time factory so Entity Framework tooling can create the context when running migrations. It reads configuration from `appsettings.json`, `appsettings.Development.json`, or environment variables.

### `Data/IdentitySeeder.cs`
Seeds initial roles (`Project Officer`, `HoD`, `Comdt`, `Admin`, `TA`, `MCO`, `Project Office`, `Main Office`) and creates a default `admin` account with the password `ChangeMe!123` if it does not already exist. The `admin` user has `MustChangePassword` set to `false` so it can log in immediately.

## Domain model

### `Models/ApplicationUser.cs`
Extends `IdentityUser` with a `MustChangePassword` flag. New accounts are created with the flag set to `true`, forcing a password change on first login via `EnforcePasswordChangeFilter`.

### `Models/Project.cs`
Holds the master record for a project. Beyond its name/description it stores the case file reference, creator, category, active plan version and assignment metadata for the Head of Department and Lead Project Officer. `PlanApprovedAt/ByUserId` capture the latest plan approval event and the navigation properties surface related user records for UI display. `ProjectStages` now owns the execution stages collection and the obsolete `Stages` property simply proxies to it for backward compatibility.

### `Models/ProjectCategory.cs`
Allows projects to be organised in a hierarchy. Each category exposes a `ParentId` so breadcrumb trails can be built and circular references are guarded against in the overview loader.

### `Models/Execution/ProjectStage.cs`
Represents each procurement or delivery milestone for a project. Rows track planned, forecast and actual dates, completion status, auto-completion metadata and whether the stage still needs backfilling. The `StageCodes` helper enumerates canonical codes (FS, IPA, SOW, …, PAYMENT) and exposes human readable display names.

### `Models/ProjectFacts.cs`
Defines fact tables that capture procurement milestones. IPA, AON, benchmark, L1 and PNC costs, along with the supply-order date and SOW sponsoring units, derive from a shared `ProjectFactBase` that records who captured the fact and when. Each fact table carries a concurrency token so editors get reliable conflict detection when procurement numbers evolve.

### `Models/TodoItem.cs`
Represents a personal task owned by a user. Each item records a title, due date (stored in UTC), priority, pin state, order index and timestamps for creation, updates, completion and soft deletion. PostgreSQL's `xmin` concurrency token is used to detect conflicting edits. Items marked completed are soft-deleted by setting `DeletedUtc`; a background worker purges entries older than the configured retention period.

### `Models/Celebration.cs`
Stores birthdays and anniversaries with minimal fields for annual recurrence. Each row tracks the event type, name(s), day and month, optional year, creator metadata and soft-delete timestamp. Indexes on `(EventType, Month, Day)` enable fast upcoming lookups and a filtered index on `DeletedUtc` hides removed entries. Leap day events are rendered on 28 February in non-leap years.

### `Models/AuthEvent.cs`
Records successful authentication events. Each row stores the user ID, timestamp (UTC), IP address and user agent for audit and analytics. Indexed by event name and time for efficient querying.

### `Models/DailyLoginStat.cs`
Holds pre-aggregated daily login counts generated by `LoginAggregationWorker`. Aggregation reduces load on the primary `AuthEvents` table for long-range reporting.

### `Models/Event.cs`
Represents a calendar event visible to all signed-in users. Each row stores a title, optional Markdown description, category, location, UTC start/end times (exclusive end), an `IsAllDay` flag and creator/updater metadata. Soft deletion hides events without removing them from the database. Categories are restricted to **Visit**, **Insp**, **Conference** and **Other**; legacy values like "Training" or "TownHall" are mapped by `CategoryParser` and unrecognised strings fall back to `Other`.

### `Models/ProjectVideo.cs`
Stores uploaded project walkthrough videos. Metadata includes the storage key, original filename, MIME type, optional duration, title, description, ordinal ordering, featured flag, and poster frame references. Videos live beneath the upload root resolved by `IUploadRootProvider`, and posters share the same deterministic folder hierarchy. (see Models/ProjectVideo.cs lines 1-38) (see Services/Projects/ProjectVideoService.cs lines 82-420)

### `Models/AuditLog.cs`
Captures structured audit entries with timestamps, action names, user metadata, IP addresses and optional payloads. Sensitive fields are scrubbed by `AuditService` before persistence.

### Transfer of Technology tracker (`Models/ProjectTot*.cs`)
`ProjectTot` holds the authoritative ToT status for a project, capturing milestones (start/completion dates, MET progression, first-production manufacture) and the last approver metadata. `ProjectTotRequest` stores pending updates with proposed values, submitter/decider metadata, and a concurrency token so approvals reject stale decisions. Both entities underpin the ToT tracker in the Project Office Reports area and are surfaced through dedicated read services. (see Models/ProjectTot.cs lines 1-37) (see Models/ProjectTotRequest.cs lines 1-38)

### Timeline planning and scheduling (`Models/Plans`, `Models/Scheduling`)
Timeline expectations are stored as `PlanVersion` rows. Each project maintains at most one open version (status **Draft** or **PendingApproval**) and a history of approved versions.

* **Draft** rows are editable by the assigned Project Officer (PO) or an administrator. Edits are captured in `StagePlan` children and persisted without affecting the live `ProjectStages` table.
* When a PO selects *Save & request approval*, `PlanApprovalService.SubmitAsync` validates the stage data and transitions the record to **PendingApproval**, stamping `SubmittedByUserId`/`SubmittedOn`. The draft becomes read-only until the Head of Department (HoD) acts.
* HoDs review diffs via `PlanCompareService.GetDraftVsCurrentAsync`, with UI highlights showing the left/right comparison. Approving publishes `StagePlan` dates into `ProjectStages`, records an immutable snapshot (`ProjectPlanSnapshot` + rows), updates `Project.PlanApprovedAt/ByUserId` and marks the version **Approved**.
* Rejecting moves the status back to **Draft**, captures optional feedback in `RejectionNote` and stamps `RejectedByUserId`/`RejectedOn`. The PO immediately regains edit access.
* The new `RejectedByUserId` column is a nullable foreign key to `AspNetUsers`; the previous `Reason` column has been renamed to `RejectionNote`.
* Backfill guards are enforced both in the UI and server (`PlanApprovalService.ApproveLatestDraftAsync`) to prevent approval while earlier stages require completion.

`PlanEditorStateVm` gathers the metadata (status, submission/rejection timestamps, lock state) consumed by Razor components so that locking, banners and validation messaging stay consistent across edit and review experiences.

`ProjectScheduleSettings` lets teams compute draft schedules from durations by storing anchors, working-day preferences and stage chaining policies, while `ProjectPlanDuration` keeps the per-stage duration catalog that powers the bulk duration editor.

### `Models/ProjectComment.cs`
Supports threaded discussions around a project or a specific stage. Comments enforce minimum/maximum lengths, carry typed categorisation (Update, Risk, Blocker, Decision, Info), allow pinning and track soft deletion. Attachments and mentions are separate tables linked back to the owning comment with foreign keys and capture uploader metadata plus sanitised filenames for storage.

### Remarks (`Models/Remarks/Remark.cs`)
Structured project remarks capture author role, scope (general vs. ToT), typed body text, optional stage references, and event dates. Soft deletion preserves history while hiding entries. Each remark carries a concurrency token, audit trail (`RemarkAudit`) with immutable snapshots, and mentions that link to `ApplicationUser` records for @mention rendering. Role names normalise across admin vocabularies to keep analytics consistent. (see Models/Remarks/Remark.cs lines 1-160)

### Notifications (`Models/Notifications/*`)
* **`Notification`** – materialised rows that power the user-facing notification centre. Metadata columns (`Module`, `EventType`, `ScopeType`, `ScopeId`, `Route`, `Title`, `Summary`) come from the original dispatch envelope and timestamps track when a user sees or reads the item. (see Models/Notifications/Notification.cs lines 5-40)
* **`NotificationDispatch`** – queue table processed by `NotificationDispatcher`. It stores the serialised payload, retry counters, dispatch timestamps, and optional error text so failed deliveries can be diagnosed. (see Models/Notifications/NotificationDispatch.cs lines 5-44)
* **`UserNotificationPreference`** – per-kind opt-in/out switches evaluated before persisting new notifications. (see Models/Notifications/UserNotificationPreference.cs lines 3-10)
* **`UserProjectMute`** – association table that hides notifications for specific projects when the user has muted them through the API. (see Models/Notifications/UserProjectMute.cs lines 3-8)

### Project documents (`Models/ProjectDocument*.cs`)
* **`ProjectDocument`** – published artefacts with metadata (title, description, stage link, storage key, MIME type, file stamp, archival state) and a `RowVersion` concurrency token to prevent conflicting edits. (see Models/ProjectDocument.cs lines 13-78)
* **`ProjectDocumentRequest`** – workflow table that tracks document uploads/replacements/deletions before publication. Includes request type, reviewer metadata, temporary storage keys, and audit notes for approvals or rejections. (see Models/ProjectDocumentRequest.cs lines 23-85)

### Process templates (`Models/Stages/StageChecklistTemplate.cs`)
Stage templates drive the process designer UI and REST APIs:
* **`StageChecklistTemplate`** – versioned container per stage code with optimistic concurrency and audit trails. (see Models/Stages/StageChecklistTemplate.cs lines 8-29)
* **`StageChecklistItemTemplate`** – ordered checklist items with per-item row versions and editor metadata. (see Models/Stages/StageChecklistTemplate.cs lines 32-52)
* **`StageChecklistAudit`** – immutable log of checklist edits, including payload snapshots and timestamps for compliance reporting. (see Models/Stages/StageChecklistTemplate.cs lines 55-76)

### Intellectual property registry (`Infrastructure/Data/Ipr*.cs`)
`IprRecord` maintains filing metadata (number, title, notes, status lifecycle, filing/grant dates, optional project linkage) with a unique constraint on filing number + type and a row-version token for concurrency. `IprAttachment` stores uploaded evidence per record and references uploader/archiver identity for audit trails. Attachments are persisted under `ipr-attachments/{recordId}` via `IprAttachmentStorage`. (see Infrastructure/Data/IprRecord.cs lines 1-44) (see Infrastructure/Data/IprAttachment.cs lines 1-37)

### Project office reports domain (`Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Domain/*`)
- **Visits** – `Visit`, `VisitType`, and `VisitPhoto` model dignitary visits with active/inactive types, attendee counts, remarks, and derivative photo metadata (caption, storage key, width/height, version stamp). (see Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Domain/Visit.cs lines 1-112) (see Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Domain/VisitPhoto.cs lines 1-120)
- **Social media** – `SocialMediaEvent`, `SocialMediaEventType`, `SocialMediaPlatform`, and `SocialMediaEventPhoto` capture campaign briefs, linked platforms, cover photos, and moderation details. (see Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Domain/SocialMediaEvent.cs lines 1-166)
- **Misc activities** – `MiscActivity` stores one-off or ad-hoc Project Office efforts that do not belong to visits, social media, or training. Required fields include a nomenclature/title, occurrence date (stored as local date, validated not to be in the future), `CapturedByUserId`, and UTC timestamps for creation/update. Optional fields allow a Markdown description, external reference link, and a soft-delete flag with `DeletedUtc` + `DeletedByUserId`. `ActivityType` provides reference data for tagging activities; it exposes `Name`, `IsActive`, audit stamps, and an ordinal for display ordering. Attachments are handled by `ActivityMedia` rows that reference their parent activity and carry storage key, original filename, media type, file size, caption, width/height metadata, and uploader identity.
  * Validation rules: nomenclature is required on `MiscActivity` and `ActivityType`. Activities reject future dates and optionally enforce uniqueness on `(OccurrenceDate, Nomenclature)` via a filtered unique index. Media rows validate that captions stay within 256 characters and that uploads provide MIME type + storage key.
  * Permissions: Project Officers and Technical Assistants (TA/PO roles) can create/edit their own activities and manage attachments. Heads of Department and Administrators (HoD/Admin roles) can review, edit, or delete any record, including restoring soft-deleted rows. View-only roles are limited to read access across activities, types, and media metadata.
- **Transfer of Technology snapshots** – `ProjectTotSummary` view models and related enums power the ToT tracker cards. (see Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Proliferation/ViewModels/ProjectTotSummaryViewModel.cs lines 1-80)
- **Proliferation tracker** – `ProliferationYearly`, `ProliferationSubmission`, `ProliferationSource`, and preferences hold per-year submissions, approval states, and reference data for origin/destination tracking. (see Areas/ProjectOfficeReports/Domain/ProliferationYearly.cs lines 1-120)

### Navigation (`Models/Navigation/NavigationItem.cs`)
Represents hierarchical navigation entries rendered in the shell. Items contain display text, Razor Page routes (with optional area), required roles, and child menus. The role-based navigation provider materialises collections per user session. (see Models/Navigation/NavigationItem.cs lines 1-33) (see Services/Navigation/RoleBasedNavigationProvider.cs lines 16-130)
