# Photo Tools

Photo Tools is a standalone workspace for changing a user's **own** photos. It is not part of
any PRISM record and is separate from the Projects photo module: PRISM only links to it. It
opens in a new browser tab from the navigation drawer (**Photo Tools**) at `/Tools/Photo`.

The build plan and owner decisions are in [ux/photo-tools.md](ux/photo-tools.md). This document
describes what is built.

## Privacy and data contract

- Every operation runs in the user's browser. Photos are read with the File API, drawn on a
  canvas and downloaded with a `blob:` link.
- Nothing is uploaded, stored, logged or retained by PRISM. The page model
  (`Pages/Tools/Photo/Index.cshtml.cs`) has only `OnGet`; there is no form post, API endpoint,
  database table or migration.
- The page requires a signed-in user (`[Authorize]`), like the rest of PRISM.
- Usage telemetry records only that the `photo-tools` module was opened
  (`ErpUsageModuleCatalog`), never file names or contents.
- A saved photo is re-drawn, so the hidden data in the original (GPS location, camera details)
  is never in the saved file. The page says so.
- The last Reduce size settings are remembered in that browser's `localStorage` only.

`ProjectManagement.Tests/Tools/PhotoToolsPageContractTests.cs` guards these points: sign-in
required, no handler other than `OnGet`, no form, no network calls in the scripts, and all
assets local.

## Offline deployment

No third-party library is used. The page loads Bootstrap, Bootstrap Icons and the Mulish font
that already ship in `wwwroot`, and its own scripts. No CDN or Internet access is needed.

The site's Content-Security-Policy already allows what the page needs: `script-src 'self'` for
its scripts and `img-src 'self' data: blob:` for the photo previews.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Reduce size | One or many JPG, PNG or WEBP photos. Target file size in KB or MB (or none), smaller dimensions, save as JPG, PNG, WEBP or the original type, optional black and white. A drag-to-compare check of the selected photo. One photo downloads as a file; several download as one ZIP. |

Passport photo, print sheet, signature and the editor are planned (see the build plan) and are
not on the page yet.

### How the target size is reached

For JPG and WEBP the tool first tries top quality (0.92). If that is over the target it searches
the quality (down to 0.4) for the best one that fits. Only when the lowest quality is still too
big are the dimensions stepped down, and the search repeats. PNG has no quality setting, so only
its dimensions are stepped down; choosing JPG is the better way to make a PNG small.

If a target cannot be reached at all, the photo is shown in amber with the size that was
reached. The tool never reports a size it did not reach.

Photos are never enlarged. Phone photos are opened the right way up (their rotation is hidden
data). Big reductions are drawn in halving steps, which keeps fine detail. Saving as JPG fills
see-through areas with white.

## Code map

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `Pages/Tools/Photo/Index.cshtml` | Standalone page with its own minimal shell (`Layout = null`). |
| `wwwroot/js/photo-tools/photo-tools-core.js` | Pure rules: target-size search, resize maths, output type and names, greyscale. Runs in Node for tests. |
| `wwwroot/js/photo-tools/photo-tools-core.test.js` | Node tests, part of `npm test`. |
| `wwwroot/js/photo-tools/photo-tools-app.js` | Shell, routing (`#tool`) and Reduce size. |
| `wwwroot/js/tools-shared/zip-writer.js` | ZIP writer shared with PDF Tools. |
| `wwwroot/css/photo-tools.css` | Photo Tools styles. The shell (top bar, home cards, drop zone) is shared with PDF Tools through `pdf-tools.css`. Bootstrap theme variables only, so Light and Dark both work. |

## Known limits

- iPhone HEIC photos are not supported; the page says so when one is chosen.
- A browser that cannot write WEBP (some older Safari versions) says so and asks for JPG or PNG.
- Everything is held in browser memory, so very large photos depend on the user's computer.
