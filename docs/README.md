# Documentation Modules

The documentation for the platform is organised into focused guides so teams can maintain each feature area independently:

- [Architecture and Configuration](architecture.md)
- [Data and Domain](data-domain.md)
- [Infrastructure and Services](infrastructure-services.md)
- [Razor Pages](razor-pages.md)
- [Extending the Module](extending.md)
- [Projects Module](projects-module.md)

Each file can be maintained independently to keep the guides concise and easier to navigate.
